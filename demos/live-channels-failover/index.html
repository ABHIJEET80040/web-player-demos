<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This demo demonstrates how to implement a failover mechanism between two Live Channels.
</p>
<p>
  The JavaScript logic on this page will automatically fetch the status of the provided live stream channels.
  As soon as the logic detects that either one of the channels becomes active, then the placeholder HTML element for the
  video player will be replaced with a new JW Player instance which plays the live event stream associated with the
  channel that has been detected as active. Once this player has been instantiated, event listeners are registered on
  the instance of the player detect any playback errors. If a playback error is detected, then the demo will attempt to
  failover to the secondary channel.
</p>
<p>
  The primary use-case of the setup demonstrated here is to support dual-encoder setups, where a broadcaster streams to
  our RTMP ingest from two different networks.
  This setup allows one of the encoders to fail, or otherwise lose connectivity without immediately losing viewership.
</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>
  While redundant Live Channels offer improved robustness on the front of encoder failure, there are also drawbacks.
  Because each channel is associated with a separate encoder, each streaming session will result in a separate event to
  be broadcast per channel. Because clients will start watching whichever channel was active first
  <em>from their perspective</em>, the entire viewer base will contribute to Analytics on two different media items with
  their respective media ids. If you are just looking to play a single Live Channel, please refer to the regular <a href="/developers/web-player-demos/live-channels">Live Channels demo</a>.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Enter the IDs of your primary and backup <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/content/live/channels">Live Channels</a> and click "Select Channels".</li>
	<li>Start broadcasting to both of your channels.</li>
  <li>The player will now automatically start playback of either one of the channels, depending on which one it found to be active first.</li>
  <li>In order to test the failover behavior, stop broadcasting to the channel which is associated with the currently playing event. The player will automatically attempt to start playback of the second channel.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	After hitting "Select Channels" the code on this page will automatically check for availability
	of a live event stream for the provided Live Channels in the background.

  Once either one of the channels has detected to be active, a JW Player will be instantiated which will play the stream
  associated with the channel that was found to be active.
