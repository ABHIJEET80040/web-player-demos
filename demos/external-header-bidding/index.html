<p>
	Below is a player configured with three playlist items. In this example, the second will be skipped
	to simulate a use case in which the user is not authenticated to view this item. Any custom logic
	can be used, but to cancel the next playlist item, the user must call <code>reject()</code> from within
	the asynchronous callback.
