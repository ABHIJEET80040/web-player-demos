<p>
	This is a demo for using the <strong>setPlaylistItemCallback</strong> API to cancel playback of the next item.
	The <strong>setPlaylistItemCallback</strong> API accepts a callback which returns a promise.
</p>
<p>This callback is invoked between each playlist item, and blocks playback of the next playlist item until the promise is resolved, or rejected.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>resolve</code> will load a playlist item, either modified or not, for playback.</p></li>
	<li><code>reject</code> cancels playback of the next scheduled item, skipping to the next playlist item (at which point, <strong>setPlaylistItemCallback</strong> will be called again).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Demonstration</h3>
<p>
	In this example, each playlist item is assigned a new ad tag. This demonstrates how a user would conduct external header bidding,
	through solutions such as Amazon A9. While this example updates the advertising tag, anything on the playlist item can be modified.
