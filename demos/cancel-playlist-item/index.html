<p>
	This is a demo for using the <strong>setPlaylistItemCallback</strong> API to cancel playback of the next item.
	The <strong>setPlaylistItemCallback</strong> API accepts a callback which returns a promise.
</p>
<p>This callback is invoked between each playlist item, and blocks playback of the next playlist item until the promise is resolved, or rejected.</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>resolve</code> will load a playlist item, either modified or not, for playback.</p></li>
	<li><code>reject</code> cancels playback of the next scheduled item, skipping to the next playlist item (at which point, <strong>setPlaylistItemCallback</strong> will be called again).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Demonstration</h3>
<p>
	In this example, the player is configured with three playlist items, the second of which will be skipped (simulated), representing
	an unauthorized user. After failing the authorization check, the third playlist item will be loaded.
